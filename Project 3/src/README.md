In <b> Project 3 </b>, I implemented a list in two different ways: as an ArrayList and as a LinkedList. In each list, a series of tests are put onto different methods regarding lists. I then compare the time complexities of a select few List methods when implemented as an ArrayList and as a LinkedList.

<b>Classes Written By Me: </b>

<b>Classes Given From Class: </b>

<li>ArrayListTest.java</li>
<li>LinkedListTest.java</li>
<li>List.java</li>
<li>Node.java</li></ul>

<b>ArrayList.java:</b>

A class that has multiple methods within that creates an Array. Functions include adding elements, increasing the size of the array, clearing the array, getting a certain item, sorting the list, removing an element, removing unwanted elements, merging the list, reversing the list, and pair swapping. Moreover, the class will keep track of whether the list is sorted. 

<b>LinkedList.java:</b>

A class similar to ArrayList.java that uses the Node.java class given. Uses nodes to do the same funtions as ArrayList.java.

<b>Analysis.txt:</b>

This file contains an analysis between certain methods in ArrayList.java and LinkedList.java to see complexity difference between arrays and linked nodes. 

<b>ArrayListTest.java & LinkedListTest.java:</b>

These files are where the tests are completed to check whether or not the code written in the respective files work correctly (junit may need to be implemented for the tests to work). 

<b>ScoringTestRule.java, WorthPoints.java, List.java, & Node.java:</b>

These classes are supportive files that will allow other parts of the project run smoothly.

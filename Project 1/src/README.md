<b>Project 1</b> involves implementing several shape classes in Java and using a recursive drawing class to create a fractal based on the shapes circles, rectangles, and triangles.

<b>Classes written by me:</b>
<ul> <li> Circle.java </li>
<li> Rectangle.java </li>
<li> Triangle.java </li>
<li> FractalDrawer.java </li> </ul>

<b>Classes given from class:</b>
<ul> <li> Canvas.java </li> </ul>

<b>Shape Classes (Circle.java, Rectangle.java, Triangle.java):</b>

Each shape is given attributes that relate to each shape like width, height, or radius. Getters and setters methods are given to each shape class in order to access or modify attributes. In all shape classes, the perimeter and area are calculated based on the shape's attributes. The position of the shape is also determined in the shape classes.

<b> FractalDrawer.java:</b>

Contains the main method in order to enter the shape desires, shape dimensions, and desired number of fractal levels. Will display the total area of the fractal. The class also contains methods that are called for each shape to create the individual recursive calls to the shape. It will call the Canvas.java class to display the resulting fractal. User may need to resize the canvas display or wait for the fractal to be fully drawn. The color of each level will also alternate.

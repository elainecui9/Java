This is the repository to save all of my java projects for the University of Minneosta Twin Cities class CSCI 1933 - Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures. Each project has a README.md file in the src that will explain the purpose of the project and what I wrote. I had a partner writing these projects, both contributing equal weight. 

<b>Project 1:</b>

This project focused on recursions to draw a fractal in the shapes of circles, triangles, and rectangles with alternating colors.

<b>Project 2:</b>

This project used a 2D array in order to create the traditional game of chess.

<b>Project 3:</b>

This project involved writing functions for Arrays and Linked Lists, then comparing their complexities. 

<b>Project 4:</b>

This project used queues and stacks to create a maze and solve the maze.

<b>Project 5:</b>

This project experimented with different hash functions in order to find the most efficient function that led to the least amount of collisions.
